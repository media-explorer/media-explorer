  • List of changes since Mex 0.1.0

    » Addition of a "touch mode". This adds some mouse navigation but also
      a bunch of touch friendly behaviours to Mex for it's use on tablet for
      instance,

    » Add a first pass on handling music files. There's is now a new column
      for music and it uses a visualisation plugin from GStreamer,

    » New dbusinput plugin that exposes a DBus API to send key events to the
      application,

    » New webremote applet, a separate HTTP daemon to control mex from a
      secondary screen,

    » Addition of an internal thumbnailer instead of using tumbler. With this,
      the thumbnails created by mex are private to the application (their size
      wasn't part of the thumbnailing spec anyway) and we use JPEG to store
      them (saves a lot of space). This thumbnailer is now the default option,

    » Lot of work on the grid to improve its behaviour and corner cases,

    » The usual bulk of small adjustments in the ui and content framework,
      various fixes (leaks/performance) and maintenance work.
